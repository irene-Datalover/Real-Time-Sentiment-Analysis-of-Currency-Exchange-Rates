This code retrieves exchange rates for the Indian Rupee (INR) against various currencies. It compares the current rates to previous ones to classify the sentiment as "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral." Two plots are generated in real-time: one shows the exchange rates for different currencies against INR, and the other visualizes the sentiment summary of rate changes, providing insights into the market trends relative to INR.
